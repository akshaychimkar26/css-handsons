        <h3><i>What is CSS?</i></h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li></br>
            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li></br>
            <li><b class="ol">Css is not neccessary</b><b class="ol1">CSS saves a lot of work.</b>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li></br>
            <li><u><i>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</i></u></li></br>
        </ol>
        <h3><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h3>
        <ul class="ulmain">
            <li>Inline - by  using  the  style  attribute  inside  HTML  elements</li>
            <li>Internal - by  using  style  element  in  the  head  section</li>
            <li>External - by  using  a  link  element  to  link  to  an  external  CSS  file.</li>
            <li>The  most  common  way  to  add  CSS,  is  to  keep  the  styles  in  external  CSS  files. However,<b class="ul">in  this  tutorial  we  will  use  inline  and  internal  styles,</b>because  this  is  easier  to  demonstrate,  and  easier  for  you  to  try  it  yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
        <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
